Why are you interested in taking CMSC320?
- I believe that taking a course that'll teach me the
fundamentals of Data Science can greatly benefit me in the
long run. As of today, I don't have a clear career path
in my head so I don't know if I'll be particularly specializing
in Data Science. However, I believe that the concepts taught in
this class can be of great use regardless of my area of work.
